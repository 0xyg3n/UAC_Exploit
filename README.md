## Proof Of Concept

## Why this occurs?

###### ComputerDefaults.exe is a native Windows 10 Microsoft digitally signed executable that has the "autoElevate" attribute set to true on it's manifest and that interacts with the Windows registry. 

###### Therefore discovering such files with this type of interaction is interesting. Simply we must detect binaries like ComputerDefaults.exe that do not find keys in the HKCU branch in order to achieve privilege escalation.

###### Finally, this can result in a process running in a high integrity context executing something that is found in an HKCU branch.
